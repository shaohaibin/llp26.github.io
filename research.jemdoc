== Research Interests

In general, I am interested in the *analysis, control, and optimization of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system complex systems]*. \n

Currently, my concentration is on 

- antagonistic and cooperative multi-agent networks,
- multi-agent systems with complex state coupling,
- data-driven/event-triggered control and optimization of network systems,
- distributed game on multi-agent networks.
